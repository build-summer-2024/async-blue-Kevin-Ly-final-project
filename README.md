## Dataset
Olympic Swimming History (1912 to 2020)

## Why did I chose this dataset?

I chose the Olympic Swimming History from 1912 to 2020 because I wanted to analyze how swimming has changed, and how fast the human pinnacle of swimming is. I have a passion for swimming and swam a lot as a kid, so I am especially curious to see the speed of each athlete.
